===================
v4 — TRADE MANAGEMENT (the robot no longer "opens and forgets")

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Before v4 the robot placed SL/TP as blind ATR multiples (1.5x / 3.0x) at
entry and then never touched them again. Step 5 only *reported* open
positions. Two problems:

  1. ATR stops ignore WHERE the big players actually sit. A stop that
     lands just above a round number or just inside an order block gets
     "hunted" (price spikes through it, then reverses). A take-profit
     placed past a wall of resting liquidity never fills because price
     reverses AT the wall.
  2. Every 60s cycle Step 2 produces a fresh read of flow, structure and
     score — and the open position ignored all of it.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
A) ENTRY-TIME STRUCTURAL STOPS  (used by step4)
   `compute_structural_stops()` replaces the blind ATR multiples:
     - SL is placed BEYOND the nearest demand/supply zone (order block),
       the POC, or a strong round number — plus a buffer — so a normal
       liquidity hunt does not take us out. ATR floor/cap keep the risk
       distance sane (this is what fixes "SL too far").
     - TP is placed just IN FRONT of the nearest opposing structure
       (supply zone / POC / VAH / strong round) so we exit where the
       big traders start banking profit, not after.
   All zone levels come from the futures feed (Step 2) and are scaled to
   the CFD trade price before use (futures 4350 != CFD 4350 exactly).

B) OPEN-POSITION MANAGEMENT  (runs every loop cycle)
   `PositionManager.manage(snapshot)` adopts every bot position (magic
   234000 — manual trades are never touched), including positions that
   were opened BEFORE the manager existed (restart-safe), and applies:

     ADOPT_TIGHTEN  first time it sees a position whose SL is wider than
                    PM_MAX_SL_ATR x ATR it tightens it to the structural
                    stop (fixes far-SL positions opened by older code).
     BE             at +PM_BE_TRIGGER_R x initial risk the SL moves to
                    entry +- spread buffer (trade is now free).
     TRAIL          SL trails behind the fresh structure (nearest demand/
                    supply zone / POC) — it only ever TIGHTENS, never
                    widens, with a cooldown between modifications.
     TP_UPDATE      TP front-runs newly-formed opposing structure. It may
                    move closer any time, and further away only once the
                    trade is break-even (a locked trade may run).
     FLIP_EXIT      the composite signal flips HARD against the position
                    (>= PM_FLIP_EXIT_SCORE) AND order flow confirms
                    (delta/pressure against) -> close early.
     DIVERGENCE_EXIT CVD diverges against the position while it is not yet
                    in decent profit -> momentum is failing -> close.
     TIME_STOP      position is older than PM_TIME_STOP_MINUTES and has
                    moved less than PM_TIME_STOP_MIN_PROGRESS of the way
                    to TP -> dead trade, free the margin/mind.

C) v4.1 IN-TRADE INTELLIGENCE (the five tools, used as a pro would)
   HTF POC        the 1h/4h volume magnets (Step 2 now attaches
                   snapshot.htf_poc) join the anchor pool: POC of a big
                   timeframe behind you = institutional floor; ahead of
                   you = magnet/target.
   FOOTPRINT      stacked-imbalance clusters are extracted live from the
   ZONES           footprint's per-price buy/sell volumes and act as
                   fresh demand/supply zones (3:1 one-sided volume over
                   >= 3 consecutive prices, with real volume behind it).
   FLOW HEALTH     the manager keeps a rolling CVD/price history across
                   cycles and classifies the move: price moving while CVD
                   disagrees = "aggressors exhausted" -> the break-even
                   trigger drops from 1.0R to 0.5R (protect early). The
                   classification + the "next step guess" is logged and
                   journaled with every action.
   VWAP REGIME     trend day (z >= +0.5 for a long): VWAP is the trail
                   anchor — SL trails behind VWAP (institutions defend
                   their average). Stretched (z >= 2.0): lock half the
                   open gain (mean-reversion risk). Range day: VWAP
                   becomes a TP magnet — the target front-runs it.

D) v4.2 THE RISK PERIMETER (what no stop-loss can protect you from)
   NEWS_PROTECT   a HIGH-impact event (CPI / NFP / FOMC) minutes away:
                   profitable positions lock their gains; in "flatten"
                   mode everything closes before the release. Losers keep
                   their structural stop (tightening a stop into pre-news
                   noise just feeds the hunt).
   SESSION_FLATTEN at PM_DAILY_FLATTEN_UTC (default 21:30) every bot
                   position closes BEFORE the XAUUSD CFD daily break —
                   a gap can jump straight OVER a stop, so the only real
                   protection is being flat. Also covers the weekend.
   SPREAD GUARD   SL/TP edits and non-urgent closes are postponed while
                   the CFD spread exceeds PM_ACTION_MAX_SPREAD_PCT —
                   never donate a spiked spread (news seconds). Urgent
                   closes (flatten) still go through.
   FLOW MEMORY    the CVD/price history survives restarts (pm_state.json),
                   so flow health no longer needs a warm-up after a
                   restart.

E) v4.3 PROFIT PROTECTION (from live observation 2026-09-15)
   PROFIT_LOCK    a profit ratchet: once the open gain reaches
                   PM_PROFIT_LOCK_MIN_ATR x ATR, the SL never gives back
                   more than PM_PROFIT_GIVEBACK (50%) of the BEST gain
                   seen. A winner can pull back half way to the lock, but
                   no further — the trade closes in profit, not at entry.
   MOMENTUM_EXIT  when a PROFITABLE position's momentum visibly rolls
                   over — flow health says "flow against the position"
                   AND the composite signal turns against it (>=
                   PM_MOMENTUM_SIGNAL, softer than the 55 flip exit) —
                   the position closes AT MARKET immediately. No waiting
                   for the TP to be touched and no giving profit back to
                   a trailing stop.
   ATR LADDER     (step 2) on a fresh/shallow bridge file the M1 ATR is
                   now estimated from the mean M1 range or the tick
                   range instead of collapsing to 0 — so entry stops,
                   buffers and every distance-based rule keep their TRUE
                   scale right after an NT restart.

Every action (and the reason for it) is journaled to
data/management_log.csv so you can audit exactly why the robot did what
it did — same philosophy as decisions_log.csv.

SAFETY
------
- SL can only move in the favourable direction. Never widened. Ever.
- Broker minimum stop distance (trade_stops_level) respected on every
  modification; invalid distances are skipped, not forced.
- One modification per position per PM_MODIFY_COOLDOWN_SECONDS.
- Manual positions (different magic) are never touched.
- Runs only when PM_ENABLE=1 AND TRADING_ENABLED=1 AND MT5 is reachable.
- Any internal error is logged and swallowed — management must never
  break the analysis pipeline.
